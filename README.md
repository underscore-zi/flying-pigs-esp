# Flying Pigs ESP

![A Elytra wearing piglin being highlighted by the mod](https://github.com/underscore-zi/flying-pigs-esp/blob/master/mod-example.png?raw=true)

Meteor module to highlight any mobs (probably piglins) with an Elytra.

---

I'm brand new to 2b2t and wanted to find an Elytra without stash hunting on foot.  

When people die with Elytra there is a chance a Piglin will pick it up and wander off with it, perhaps so the owner can't find it when they get back, or maybe just don't care. Eitherway, there are Piglins in the nether you can kill for their Elytra this is to help you find them.

# Install

Download the latest  dev build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/underscore-zi/flying-pigs-esp/releases) and install like any other Meteor module.

# Auditing

There are malicious mods out there, and I've got no reputation so I've done a couple things to help establish myself:

The project is a direct fork from the [Meteor Addon Template](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-addon-template/tree/master) so you can see exactly what I changed from a presumably trusted root. And, this includes the build and release workflows which come from Meteor so you can trust that the releases are built with the same source code as is present in the repo.
